# simulating-mlops-lifecyle

This is a project to replicate the conditions and procedures in a production enviroment of MLOps.

So here we will find how to approximate the MLOps without cloud infrastructure, but it can be extrapolated to cloud changing some functions and paths.

### Steps to replicate this repo:

```sh
git clone <ssh code>
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```
